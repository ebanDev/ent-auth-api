This is a typescript API made to easily get cookies from your ENT (Espace Num√©rique de Travail) account.

This project is made using [Deno](https://deno.land/) and is meant to be used as a [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions).

Currently only supports the [ENT of Bretagne, Toutatice](https://www.toutatice.fr/).

If you want to add support for another ENT, feel free to open a pull request.
